For each distribution, there are four kinds of functions in R: `d` density, `p` cumulative probability(?), `q` quantile, and `r` random. 
Take the normal distribution (Gaussian distribution) as an example, 
there are `dnorm(x，mean=0,sd=1,log=FALSE)`, `pnorm(x，mean=0,sd=1)`, `qnorm()`, and `rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=1)`.

Example:
rgamma(n, shape, scale=1)
